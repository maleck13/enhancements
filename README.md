# Praxis Enhancement Proposals

Enhancement proposals for [Praxis] repositories.

## How New Features Happen

Most of the time features show up on the individual repositories
to which they belong:

```
Issue -> Triage -> Accepted -> Work it
```

1. **Open an issue.** Describe what you want and
   why. It starts life labeled
   `triage/needs-triage`.

2. **Maintainers triage it.** They mark it either
   `triage/accepted` or `triage/declined`. If a
   change is large enough to need a written
   proposal first, maintainers will say so
   clearly (`triage/needs-proposal`).

3. **Build it.** Once accepted, it's fair game to
   work on according to its project status and
   milestone.

For much larger efforts you may be asked to follow the
[docs/process.md](docs/process.md) which is more involved.

> **Nothing here is guaranteed.** Acceptance does
> not guarantee a feature ships, and a feature can
> be changed, reworked, or removed at any stage.
